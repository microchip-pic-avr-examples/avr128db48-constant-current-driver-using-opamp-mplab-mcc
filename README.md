A new feature introduced in the AVR速 DB MCU is the Analog Signal Conditioning (OPAMP) peripheral. In this example, the OPAMP is used as a constant-current driver using a single external resistor. It can be used to drive a load such as LEDs, with constant current and not constant voltage. The OPAMP peripheral also provides the ability to adjust the current setting under firmware control. The configuration for this example can be seen in the figure above. For more information about setup and code, see the [application note](https://microchip.com/DS00003632).

## Software Used

* [MPLAB速 X](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide) v5.45 or later
* [MPLAB速 XC8 Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers) v2.31 or later

## Hardware Used

* [AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/EV35L43A)
* One resistor (value dependent on desired current)
* Load (LED, etc)

## Demo Configuration
* Connect the load, such as an LED, between PD2 (OP0OUT) and PD3 (OP0INN) as shown in the schematic above
* Connect a resistor, R3, from PD3 (OP0INN) to GND. The value of R3 determines the amperage of the constant current. For instance, using R3 = 205立 will yield a current of 1mA with this example implementation. See the [application note](https://microchip.com/DS00003632) for more information on how to configure R3 to produce a constant current with a specific amperage.
* To change the constant current level value in firmware with MCC, click on the *MCC* button in MPLAB X and click on the *OPAMP* peripheral under *Project Resources*. In the *OPAMP* tab, under *Easy Seup* find and click on the *OP0* tab. Use the drop down menu on the *MUXWIP: Multiplexer for Wiper Multiplexer* setting to change the amperage of the constant current according to the formula described in the [application note](https://microchip.com/DS00003632). 

## Running the Demo in MPLAB X
* Connect the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano to a computer using a USB cable
* Download the *.zip file or clone the example to get the source code
* Open `avr128db48-constant-current-driver-using-opamp-mplab-mcc.X` in MPLAB X
* Press the make and program button to program the device
* If no tool has been chosen, a window will open, select the AVR128DB48 Curiosity Nano. The tool can also be choosen in the project settings. 

## Conclusion
After going through this example you should have a better understanding of how to set up the OPAMP peripheral as a constant current driver with a specific amperage for a load.
